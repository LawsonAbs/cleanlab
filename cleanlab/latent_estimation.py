    1. For each holdout set, we compute the confident joint, then sum them up.
    2. Compute pred_proba for each fold, combine, compute the confident joint.
    (1) is more accurate because it correctly computes thresholds for each fold
    (2) is more accurate when you have only a little data because it computes
    the confident joint using all the probabilities. For example if you had 100
    examples, with 5-fold cross validation + uniform p(y) you would only have 20
    examples to compute each confident joint for (1). Such small amounts of data

    py := P(y=k) and the inverse noise matrix P(y=k_y|s=k_s) specify one
    another, meaning one can be computed from the other and vice versa.

    Do not set iterations too high or performance will decrease as small
    deviations will get perturbed over and over and potentially magnified.

    Note that we have to first converge the inverse_noise_matrix and py,
    then we can update the noise_matrix, then repeat. This is because the
    inverse noise matrix depends on py (which is unknown/latent), but the
    noise matrix depends on ps (which is known), so there will be no change in
    the noise matrix if we recompute it when py and inverse_noise_matrix change.

    inverse_noise_matrix : np.array of shape (K, K), K = number of classes

    UNLIKE compute_confident_joint, this function calibrates
    the confident joint estimate P(s=i, y=j) such that

    Parameters
    ----------

    s : np.array
        A discrete vector of labels, s, which may contain mislabeling. "s"
        denotes  the noisy label instead of \tilde(y), for ASCII reasons.

    psx : np.array (shape (N, K))
        P(label=k|x) is a matrix with K (noisy) probabilities for each of the N
        examples x. This is the probability distribution over all K classes, for
        each example, regarding whether the example has label s==k P(s=k|x). psx

    thresholds : iterable (list or np.array) of shape (K, 1)  or (K,)
        P(s^=k|s=k). If an example has a predicted probability "greater" than
        this threshold, it is counted as having hidden label y = k. This is
        not used for pruning, only for estimating the noise rates using
        confident counts. This value should be between 0 and 1. Default is None.

    force_ps : bool or int
        If true, forces the output confident_joint matrix to have p(s) closer to
        the true p(s). The method used is SGD with a learning rate of eta = 0.5.
        If force_ps is an integer, it represents the number of epochs. Setting
        this to True is not always good. To make p(s) match, fewer confident
        examples are used to estimate the confident_joint, resulting in poorer
        estimation of the overall matrix even if p(s) is more accurate.

    return_list_of_converging_cj_matrices : bool (default = False)
        When force_ps is true, it converges the joint count matrix that is
        returned. Setting this to true will return the list of the converged
